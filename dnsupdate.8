.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B dnsupdate
utility authenticates to an Active Directory DNS server
as a computer object, and updates its IP address.
.PP
The
.B dnsupdate
utility should be run whenever the primary interface's IP address is configured.
This is normally arranged by
dnsupdate-install-hooks(8).
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.RI \-a\  auth-domain
specifies the authoritative domain to use when updating.
This is normally the "parent" domain of the hostname.
For example, the authoritative domain of host.example.com
is typically example.com.
The default is to determine the authoritative domain by performing
an SOA query.
.TP
.RI \-C\  client-spn
specifies the Kerberos service principal name of the local host
used in secure updates.
The default is "host/".
.TP
.RI \-h\  hostname
specifies the fully qualified domain name of the entry to update.
The default, when using secure updates, is to the hostname 
of the computer object corresponding to the system host principal.
When using unsecure updates, the default hostname is obtained from the 
operating system, and affixed if necessary by the resolver configuration.
.TP
\-I
use the IETF's
.I gss-tsig
algorithm name when securely updating (see RFC 3654).
The default is to use
.I gss.microsoft.com
which is understood by Active Directory.
.TP
\-N
disable secure authentication.
This option is the same as specifying \-o\ UpdateSecurityLevel=16.
.TP
\-r
Always attempt to update the reverse (PTR) record for the given
.IR ipaddr .
This option is the same as specifying \-o\ RegisterReverseLookup=1.
.TP
.RI \-o\  option = value
Overrides an option setting.
See the section on Configuration Options, below.
.TP
.RI \-s\  nameserver
specifies a whitespace-separated list of nameserver 
to send the update requests to.
The default is to try the primary authoritative nameserver associated with the 
authoritative domain,
and if that fails, to try all the nameservers that serve the 
authoritative domain, in order.
.TP
.RI \-S\  server-spn
specifies the Kerberos service principal name of the nameserver
to use in secure updates.
This typically only makes sense when the \-s option is used.
By default, the nameserver's service principal name is computed by 
prefixing its fully qualified domain name with "dns/".
.TP
.RI \-t\  ttl
specifies the updated records cache lifetime, in seconds.
If not provided, defaults to
fifteen minutes.
Note that this value is
.B not
the same as the DHCP lease time.
If specified as zero, the DNS entry will be deleted instead of updated.
This option is the same as specifying
.RI \-o\ RegistrationTtl= ttl .
.TP
\-v
increases the verbosity of messages written to standard error.
.TP
\-V
displays the version information of the program, then exits.
.SS "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
The following options are read from the configuration file,
.IR /etc/opt/quest/dnsupdate.conf ,
before argument processing begins.
These are deliberately similar to the Group Policy settings
for Microsoft's DNS client.
.TP
.RI UpdateSecurityLevel\ =\  level
A
.I level
of 0 (the default) causes
.B dnsupdate
to try an unsecure update first,
and if that fails then a secure update.
A
.I level
of 16 causes only unsecure updates to be attempted.
A
.I level
of 256 causes only secure updates to be attempted.
.TP
.RI RegistrationTTL\ =\  ttl
See the description for the \-t option, above.
.TP
.RI RegisterReverseLookup\ =\  level
A
.I level
of 0 disables all PTR update attempts.
A
.I level
of 1 enables all PTR update attempts.
A
.I level
of 2 (the default) enables PTR update attempts only if A updates succeed.
.TP
.RI RegistrationEnabled\ =\  integer
If this option is set to 0 then
.B dnsupdate
will refuse to perform any dynamic updates.
The default setting is 1.
.TP
.RI UpdateTopLevelDomainZones\ =\  integer
When this option is set to 0 (the default), then
.B dnsupdate
refuses to perform dynamic updates when the authoritative domain
is either the root domain ("."), or a top-level domain (such as "com").
.PP
If Vintela Group Policy (vasgp) is installed, the configuration file
may be altered by
.IR /opt/quest/libexec/vgp/xlators/Machine/quest-dnsupdate-xlator .
See vgptool(1) for more information.
.SS "EXIT STATUS"
The
.B dnsupdate
utility exits with status 0 if the update for the A record succeeded.
